# Mjolnir_Update
I am expanding the blender tool in Halo 3 to more maps. 
I just finished Foundry so there is support for Sandbox
and Foundry now. Will keep updating here as I get more 
maps done. 

The actual .blend files will not show in the repo as they
are to large to upload. Just the code will show here.
